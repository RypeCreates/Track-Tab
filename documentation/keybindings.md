# [Track Tab](./index.md): Keybindings and Keyboard Shortcut Navigation

[TOC]

## Overview

Track Tab will have universally available keybindings to supply the user with quick forward and back navigation.

## Chronological Tab Structure

Track Tab will operate agnostically with respect to the actual order of browser tabs in the active browser window. 

## Keybindings


Keyboard shortcut navigation is styled similarly to VS Code's default **Go Forward** and **Go Back** shortcuts.

#### VS Code Default Shortcuts (macOS):
- **Go Forward:** `^-` (navigates the user to the previously viewed tab)
- **Go Back:** `^⬆-` (navigates the user to the next-latest tab)

We can figure out which key bindings are best to default to. Some substitute bindings could include `Alt+⬅` and  `Alt+⮕` for back and forward navigation. 


Navigating via keyboard shortcut should not affect the chronological order of the tabs.

The user should be able to access _any_ currently open tab on the browser window by means of the forward and back keybindings.
