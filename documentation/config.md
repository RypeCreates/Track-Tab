# [Track Tab](./index.md): Configuration

## Overview

We will eventually want some amount of configurations available to our users so they can control variables like the color of any highlighted tabs, edit their keybindings, etc. 

We'll have to figure out how chrome extensions are typically made configurable and work off of that. 

We would probably want a new page with a form view for our configs. 


As part of the MVP we could just support out of the box functionality without configs.
